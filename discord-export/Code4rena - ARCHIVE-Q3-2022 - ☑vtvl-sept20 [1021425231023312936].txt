Hey everyone! Lawrence @endgamebro and myself are 2 of the 3 cofounders of VTVL 👋🏼 To answer @Respx ‘s question, our name was inspired by SpaceX’s ‘Vertical Takeoff, Vertical Landing’ technology where we aim to help companies successfully launch and manage their tokens, ensuring sustainability throughout the lifecycle of the project hence Visualise, Track, Vest, Launch.

how is `VariableSupplyERC20Token` related to `VTVLVesting` ?

@endgamebro @nisha


[09/21/2022 10:24 AM] _oceansky
Nice idea, somehow the project simply offer outsourcing of token management. 😀  Kinda unique for me.

Till now I am not able to find a bug worthy to be under medium or high lol


[09/21/2022 5:18 PM] Noah3o6#2496
this possibly sounds dumb, but which contracts are under scope? Cant find the under scope section on the contest site


[09/21/2022 5:18 PM] caventa
Until now, I don't think the contract has any problem LOL


[09/21/2022 5:18 PM] supernovahs
ya


[09/21/2022 5:19 PM] supernovahs
And only 187 lines to check mainly


[09/21/2022 5:19 PM] codingnamekiki
Scope:
1.FullPremintERC20Token.sol (8 sloc)
2.VariableSupplyERC20Token.sol (21 sloc)
3.AccessProtected.sol (23 sloc)
4.VTVLVesting.sol (187 sloc)

thank you

hi5 

[09/21/2022 6:00 PM] anonnp
Can you answer this here? And same for `FullPremintERC20Token` - why are the contracts in `token/` even for audit, the docs don't explain how you plan to use them - it looks like the vesting contract has nothing to do with those, it just works with ERC20 tokens

{Reactions}
☝️ 

[09/21/2022 6:37 PM] Bahurum#2516
> hello @Bahurum , in the actually application we would allow user (founders) to do the minting (or importing existing ERC20) and use the tokens for funding the vesting contract 
> and in the minting case we allow for both Fixed and VariableSupply

[09/21/2022 6:37 PM] Bahurum#2516
This is the answer to my question that I got by DM


[09/21/2022 8:46 PM] anonnp
Shall we assume that VTVLVesting will work only with those two ERC20 implementations in the contract or we should assume any ERC20 can be used with it


[09/21/2022 9:10 PM] tofunmi
Any erc20 I believe
It is in the docs


[09/21/2022 11:13 PM] chatch
@nisha @endgamebro 

vtvl.io mentions `the smart contract VTVL created has been audited by Quantstamp and Certik in May 2022.`

Are these reports available and if so shall we assume any unaddressed issues in those are out of scope?  Or .. did those reports cover some different smart contracts?


[09/22/2022 5:28 AM] csanuragjain
@endgamebro dmed you with few questions


[09/22/2022 9:00 AM] johnnytime

[09/22/2022 10:13 AM] illilli000
@endgamebro @nisha Is VTVLVesting meant to only ever be used as-is, or are there cases where you expect that it will be extended by a project somehow?


[09/22/2022 1:03 PM] JohnSmith#1623
I am not surprised, wardens here are always able to find high severity in smallest blocks of code or in smallest i++ statements.
I am amazed of their creativity.

Can we please not discuss bug-related issues before the contest ends?
I think the channel should stick to technical content like questions about code, running test etc. and not discuss the amount of bugs or security analysis of the code

M-05 makes it clear the name of the game is to find an obscure bug, not the highest risk level. M-05 $3011 while H-01 is $218.

Confused on this one, how does reentrancy work in this case?


[11/03/2022 7:47 PM] alextheentreprenerd
If it's ERC777 you can hook before the transfer, meaning the balance hasn't changed and you can get it to transfer twice or more, effectively stealing the `numTokensReservedForVesting`

Hey guys, please explain for me. Why should we divide 2**112 by 10e18?
